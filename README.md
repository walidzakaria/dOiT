# dOiT app
Have you ever tried to find someone near by you who can fix your TV set, or paint your house? Have you tried to look for a specific service in your local town but you failed to find that?! I'm sure you're tried to search on Facebook groups, and tried to ask your friends :wink: .
Do you have another job as a freelancer? Are you encountering a problem to adviertise yourself?
```dOiT application``` is the real solution for both situations :smile:
```dOiT``` is a very simple search engine to shows you all the nearby people who are presenting special services, all what you need is to define your location, and search.
```dOiT``` will do the job for your, it will give you a list of all the people who are nearby you and providing the searched service. It will also sort them as below:
1. Closest to furthest.
2. Highly rated to less rated.
3. People who made this service more regular rather than the others.
